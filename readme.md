### This is my academic programming project, tools rental management system
How to run:
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to `toolsRental/db` and run all .sql files in this order:\
`db.sql` => `trigger1.sql` => `trigger2.sql` => `trigger3.sql` => `trigger4.sql` => `data.sql`
3. Get connection string, replace with mine, and then you're good to go :)
